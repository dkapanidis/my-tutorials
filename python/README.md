# Python Tutorial

This is a collection of high-speed learning tutorial for Python.

It's high-speed because it's not focused on learning the internals of python language but on practical use-cases from low-level to more abstract ones.

Each day depends on previous lessons learned, but if you know the scope of a specific day you can skip ahead.
