# Laptop > CLI

Setup of CLI environment and useful tools.

## Setup CLI

### iTerm

For Terminal emulator I use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/). Installed with `brew`.

### Zsh

My favorite shell is [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/). Installed with `brew`.

To set zsh as your default shell, execute the following:

```sh
sudo sh -c "echo $(which zsh) >> /etc/shells" && chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

For Zsh Theme I use [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k):

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
```
